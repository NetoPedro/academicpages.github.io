This workshop at ISEP, Portugal originated from an invitation of the ["Nucleo de Estudantes de Inform√°tica"](https://www.nei-isep.org/). The crowd was composed of students and professionals of the field that were eager to learn some base concepts of machine learning and be instructed on how to start their very first machine learning project.
