Implementation of a RL agent to fold RNA sequences for the CS-E4880 - Machine Learning in Bioinformatics course at Aalto University, Finland.

The secondary structure of RNA plays an important role in several aspects in a myriad of biological systems and processes. In this project I have attepmted to implement and reinforcement learning agent to learn how to fold RNA sequences in optimal secundary structures, considering the number of free pairs as the measure of optimality.
