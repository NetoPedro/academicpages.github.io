Final project for the CS-E4890 - Deep Learning course at Aalto University, Finland. 

In this project, I have implemented a variation of the popular U-Net to segment and spot opacities that may indicate pneumonia on X-Ray images. Some experiments with different upsample techniques were particularly interesting.
