On this project I intend to implement some of the most popular papers that describe effective Deep Neural Networks architectures. The resources in this project aim to help any beginner to become familiar with some popular architectures in the literature. The papers on my list are: 

- [AlexNet](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks)

- [VGG16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06798)

- [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06904)

- [GoogLeNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842)

- [Inception](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567)

- [Xception](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02357)

- [MobileNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861)
