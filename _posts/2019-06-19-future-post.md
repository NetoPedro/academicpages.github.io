Welcome to my website!

It finally seems to be the perfect time to complete my online website, I am finishing my masters, I have created enough content to build a modest portfolio and I do intend to keep growing. It is also my presentation card to the industry, gathering my achievements, my ideas to the future and all the information about what I am currently working on or interested in. 

This particular blog section is where I will be discussing some project ideas, previous projects difficulties, and some thoughts asking to get out of my head and shared with the community. 

Hope you enjoy and please let me know if you think that I must, or I can improve anything. 

Best wishes,
Pedro Neto.
