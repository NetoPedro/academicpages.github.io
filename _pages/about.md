My name is Pedro Neto, I am a master degree student at Aalto University, Finland. I'm specializing in Computer Science with a keen interest in Deep Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning. I have an honors bachelor degree in Informatics Engineering at ISEP,  Portugal. 

Interests 
======
I am interested in applications of Machine Learning in several use cases. Nevertheless,  I have a special satisfaction while working on healthcare application. On the [Projects](https://netopedro.github.io/portfolio/) section it is possible to see some ideas I've implemented either as personal project or some course final project.
