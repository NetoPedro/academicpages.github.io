My name is Pedro Neto, I am a master degree student at Aalto University, Finland. I'm specializing in Computer Science with a keen interest in Deep Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning. I have an honors bachelor degree in Informatics Engineering at ISEP,  Portugal. 

Interests 
======
I am interested in applications of Machine Learning in several use cases. Nevertheless,  I have a special enthusiasm while working on healthcare application. In the [Portfolio](https://netopedro.github.io/portfolio/) section it is possible to see some ideas I've implemented either as personal project or some course final project. 


Future
======
In order to improve my knowledge in the field and to build a stronger set of skill on hands-on projects, I've established some goals, and some personal projects I would like to work on in the near future. 

Goals
------
* Dive deeper on state of the art literature.
* Reimplement models described in the literature.
* Improve my research skills set.
* Publish my first paper.
* Apply to PhD.

Project Ideas
------
* Use pose estimation to teach an agent how to box. 
* Use gans to generate "infinite" virtual environment for games. 
* Use CNNs and Reinforcement Learning to build a drone to spot trash on the beach and estabilish an efficient route to recoil it. 
* Use CNNs to estimate the winner of a boxing match.
