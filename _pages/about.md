My name is Pedro Neto, I hold a honors Master's degree in Computer Science from [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en), Finland. I have studied mostly machine learning and deep learning methods, and I have also worked as a research assistant on deep learning projects. I also hold a honors Bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering by [ISEP](http://isep.ipp.pt/),  Portugal. 

Interests 
======
I am interested in applications of Machine Learning in several use cases. In the [Portfolio](https://netopedro.github.io/portfolio/) section you can see some ideas I've implemented either as personal project or some course final project. As for my PhD I am really interested in working with real problems in the Machine Learning/Deep Learning domain that can have some positive impact in the society.

Future
======
In order to improve my knowledge in the field and to build a stronger set of skill on hands-on projects, I have defined some goals, and some personal projects I would like to work on in the near future. 

Goals
------
* Dive deeper on SOTA literature.
* Reimplement models described in the literature.
* Improve my research skills set.
* Publish my first paper.
* Apply to PhD.
